# Bmi_Calculator
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that helps determine if a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their weight and height. It calculates BMI by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. This metric is widely used to assess general health and guide lifestyle and medical decisions.

# Description
In this project, I used Android Studio as the development platform and Java as the primary programming language to create a BMI Calculator application. The user interface was developed using XML, providing a clean and user-friendly layout for entering weight, height, age, and gender. The application calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) in two ways based on the user's age:

* For users aged 2 to 20 years, the app uses the LMS (Lambda-Mu-Sigma) method to compute age- and gender-specific BMI Z-scores and percentiles, providing a more accurate health assessment based on growth standards.

* For users aged above 20 years, the app uses the standard BMI formula to determine health status using conventional weight and height inputs.
